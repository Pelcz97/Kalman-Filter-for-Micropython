# Kalman filter params:
  # dt="time between two updates"
  # n="number of states"
  # m="number of measurements"
  # A="System dynamics matrix: nxn"
  # At="System dynamics matrix (dynamic part): nxn"
  # C="Output matrix: mxn"
  # Q="Process noise covariance: nxn"
  # Q_coeff="coefficients of the dynamic part of Q"
  # Q_exponent="exponents of the time differnce"
  # Q_variance="variance of the process noise"
  # R="Measurement noise covariance: mxm"
  # P="Estimate error covariance: nxn"
  # x0="start state vector"
  
  
  # x0 can be empty
  # if At is empty or not valid -> update with delta_t is not available
  # if Q_coeff is empty or not valid -> Q_exponent and Q_variance are not considered and 
  #     update of the Q matrix is not available
